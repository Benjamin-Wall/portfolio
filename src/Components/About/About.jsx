      <p>
        I am currently learning how to be a Full Stack Developer! I am also from
        the United Kingdom!. I have had a passion for computers since I was
        little, I always wanted to learn how stuff worked and why. Growing up I
        became more tech-savvy and decided this is what I want to dedicate my
        life to.
